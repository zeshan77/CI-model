# What is it about
This model class outlines the most common functions used in almost evenry codeigniter model. This class contains those
common functions and wrapped into a single class to make your models more clean and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

# How it can help you
As every model has some common functions, here we've tried to consolidate all those into a single class and use it
in any model. Hence you won't need to write same functions again and again.

#Installation
Place this [MY_Model.php](application/core/MY_Model.php) class inside application/core/ and extend `MY_Model` instead of `CI_Model` in rest of the
models.
